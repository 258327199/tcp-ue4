Meant to be styled like https://github.com/getnamo/socketio-client-ue4 but for raw tcp sockets. Due to no dependencies this should work on a wider variety of platforms.

## How to use - Basics
 
_Not yet written_. For now see https://github.com/getnamo/udp-ue4#how-to-use---basics as this plugin follows the udp plugin concepts closely but with bi-directional sockets instead.
